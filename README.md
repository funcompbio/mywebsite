# Mywebsite

This is a template repo for practising developing a website and hosting it
with
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The sole purpose of this repo is
to act as a template for a
[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) assignment that will create
a private copy under a organization that will allow the student to create a GitHub
Pages website only visible with the GitHub student credentials.
